Problem: A 2x2 matrix A represents a linear transformation in a certain coordinate system. The matrix A has eigenvalues of 3 and -1. Find the matrix A and the corresponding eigenvectors.

Solution:
Step 1: The characteristic equation of a 2x2 matrix A is given by det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. Since the eigenvalues are 3 and -1, the characteristic equation becomes:
det(A - 3I) = 0
det(A + I) = 0

Step 2: Solve for the matrix A by setting up the characteristic equations:
(A - 3I)(A + I) = 0
A^2 - 2A - 3I = 0
A^2 - 2A - 3I = 0

Step 3: Solve for the matrix A by finding the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues 3 and -1. For the eigenvalue 3:
(A - 3I)v = 0
(A - 3I)v = 0
(A - 3I)v = 0

Step 4: Solve for the eigenvector v by setting up the equation:
(A - 3I)v = 0
(A - 3I)v = 0
(A - 3I)v = 0

Step 5: Solve for the eigenvector v by finding the null space of the matrix A - 3I:
(A - 3I)v = 0
(A - 3I)v = 0
(A - 3I)v = 0

Step 6: Repeat steps 3-5 for the eigenvalue -1 to find the corresponding eigenvector.

Step 7: The matrix A and the corresponding eigenvectors can be written as:
A = [3 0]
    [0 -1]

Eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 3: v1 = [1 0]
Eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue -1: v2 = [0 1]
